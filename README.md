# MI-EEG-BCI-VR
This Data describes a framework known as MI-EEG-BCI-VR, integrating Motor Imagery (MI) and electroencephalography (EEG)-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technologies, enabling users to navigate Virtual Environments (VEs) by imagining movements. The subject-specific feature extraction approach was employed.
